# SPEC.md — Singapore Events Curation App

## 1. Product Overview

**One-liner:** A single-page website showing ~10 curated, quality events happening in Singapore in the next 7 rolling days. Automated scraping + LLM filtering. For culturally curious people aged 20-40 who are tired of digging through noise.

**Core insight:** Singapore has plenty of interesting things happening (Ottolenghi talks, Chinese orchestra performances, skate festivals, ballet, exhibitions) — but they're scattered across a dozen websites buried under corporate events, bar promos, and kids' workshops. Nobody aggregates AND filters for taste.

**Design philosophy:** Show only what's worth someone's time. If it's a quiet week, show fewer events. Never pad. Honesty over volume.

---

## 2. Target User

- Age 20-40, lives in Singapore (expat or local)
- Culturally curious — open to ballet, rap, food festivals, sports, art exhibitions
- Currently discovers events through word of mouth, Instagram, or not at all
- Doesn't want to scroll through 200 Eventbrite listings to find 5 good ones
- Would appreciate being surprised ("I didn't know this was happening")

**The test for every event:** "Would a couple in their 20s-40s genuinely consider doing this on a Saturday?"

---

## 3. Feature Set (V1)

### 3.1 Public Website — Single Page

- **Rolling 7-day window** from today. Always shows "next 7 days" regardless of when you visit
- **← → navigation arrows** to browse previous/future weeks
- **Event cards** displaying:
  - Date (day of week + date, e.g. "SAT 22 FEB")
  - Event title
  - Venue name
  - One-sentence blurb (LLM-generated)
  - Tags as colored pills
  - Link to source/tickets (opens in new tab)
- **Empty state** when no events pass the filter: a single cheeky line like "Quiet week. Singapore's charging up." — not an apology, a personality moment
- **Email subscribe** — single email input field, minimal. "Get the list every Thursday." Uses Resend free tier (3,000 emails/month)
- **"Heads Up" section** — below the main event feed, above the subscribe form
  - Shows max 3 events beyond the 7-day window that are worth booking now
  - LLM-auto-selected during the blurb+tags pipeline (no admin involvement required)
  - Each card shows the actual event date, title, venue, blurb, tags
  - Cards have a left accent border to visually distinguish from the main feed
  - Section header: "MARK YOUR CALENDAR" with subtitle "Coming up — worth booking now."
  - Renders nothing when no heads-up events exist (no empty state)
  - Static regardless of week navigation (always anchored to today + 7 days)
  - Events auto-transition to the main feed when their date enters the 7-day window
- **Footer** with one-liner about the project

### 3.2 Admin Panel

- Password-protected route (/admin, simple hardcoded password or env var)
- **Manual event submission:** paste a URL → backend fetches page content → LLM generates blurb + tags → preview → approve/reject/edit → publish
- **Event moderation view:** see all events (scraped + manual), toggle visibility, edit blurbs/tags
- **Event analytics:** basic event visibility tracking via admin panel

### 3.3 Scraping Pipeline

- **4 scrapers** running daily at 3:00 AM SGT via cron:
  1. **Eventbrite Singapore** — filter by Singapore location
  2. **TheKallang.com.sg** — Sports Hub events calendar
  3. **Esplanade.com** — performing arts, concerts, recitals
  4. **SportPlus.sg** — running events, community sports, fitness events
- Scrapers write raw events to database with source, scraped date, raw title, raw description, URL, venue, dates
- **Cross-source deduplication:** After scraping and before LLM processing, an algorithmic dedup step (no LLM calls) fuzzy-matches events on title + date + venue across sources. Duplicates are marked in the DB (`is_duplicate`, `duplicate_of`) and skipped by the LLM pipeline. Admin can manually un-mark duplicates via the PATCH endpoint.
- **Health monitoring:** Each scraper run is logged to the `scraper_runs` table (source, event count, error, timestamp). If any scraper returns 0 events or errors during a cron run, an alert email is sent to `ADMIN_EMAIL`. The admin panel includes a "Scraper Health" tab showing the last 7 days of run history with status indicators (OK / 0 events / Error) per source.

### 3.4 LLM Pipeline (two separate calls)

**Call 1 — Filter (Claude Haiku):**
- Input: raw event title + description + venue + dates
- System prompt encodes the filtering rules (see Section 6)
- Output: `{ "include": true/false, "reason": "string" }`
- Cost: ~$0.01 per 100 events

**Call 2 — Blurb + Tags (Claude Haiku):**
- Only runs on events that passed the filter
- Input: raw event title + description + venue
- System prompt encodes tone and tag vocabulary (see Section 6)
- Output: `{ "blurb": "One sentence, max 200 chars", "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"] }`
- Cost: ~$0.005 per event

**Total monthly cost estimate:** ~200 raw events/day × 30 days = 6,000 filter calls + ~300 blurb calls = well under $5/month on Haiku.

### 3.5 Email Digest

- Sent every Thursday at 6:00 PM SGT
- Plain, clean HTML email — just the event list with links
- Same content as the website but delivered
- One-click unsubscribe
- Provider: Resend (free tier: 3,000 emails/month, 100/day)

## 4. Tags Vocabulary

Fun, short, personality-driven. The tag names are inspired by Pit Viper's approach to labeling — personality over corporate.

| Tag | Used for | Color suggestion |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| `live & loud` | Concerts, live music, DJ sets | Electric blue |
| `culture fix` | Orchestra, ballet, opera, theatre | Deep purple |
| `go see` | Museum exhibitions, art shows, gallery openings | Warm amber |
| `game on` | Spectator sports, tournaments | Green |
| `screen time` | Film screenings, film festivals | Soft red |
| `taste test` | Wine events, food festivals, tastings, supper clubs | Burgundy |
| `touch grass` | Running events, outdoor activities, active stuff | Lime green |
| `free lah` | No cost events | Gold |
| `last call` | Ending within 7 days | Orange/warning |
| `bring someone` | Great for a date or bringing friends | Pink |
| `once only` | One-time events, limited, rare appearances | White/silver |
| `try lah` | Something outside comfort zone, unexpected | Teal |

Events get 1-3 tags max. LLM assigns them.

## 6. LLM Prompts

### Filter Prompt (System)

```
You are a strict event curator for a website that recommends quality cultural and lifestyle events in Singapore to people aged 20-40.

Your job: decide if an event should be INCLUDED or EXCLUDED.

INCLUDE events that are:
- Performing arts: concerts, ballet, orchestra, opera, theatre, dance, comedy
- Exhibitions: museum shows, art exhibitions, gallery openings, photography shows
- Sports: spectator sports events, tournaments, major races (as a viewer or participant)
- Music: live music of any genre (classical, jazz, rock, rap, electronic, indie)
- Film: screenings, film festivals, special cinema events
- Food & drink: wine tastings, food festivals, supper clubs, culinary experiences (not just restaurant openings or happy hours)
- Cultural: author talks, book launches with notable authors, cultural festivals, heritage events
- Active: notable runs, cycling events, outdoor festivals
- Unique one-off experiences that a curious person would find interesting

EXCLUDE events that are:
- Corporate: conferences, networking events, "build your LinkedIn" type meetups, industry summits
- Promotions: bar deals, 1-for-1 offers, happy hours, brand activations that are just ads
- Recurring paid workshops: "make your own candle $200", "pottery class every Saturday" — things that are permanent commercial offerings, not events
- Kids-only: events exclusively for children or families with young kids
- Webinars or online-only events
- MLM, crypto meetups, get-rich-quick seminars
- Generic: "networking mixer", "professionals meetup", vague community gatherings with no specific draw
- Religious services (cultural religious festivals ARE ok)

Respond with JSON only:
{"include": true/false, "reason": "brief explanation"}
```

### Blurb + Tags Prompt (System)

```
You write one-sentence event descriptions for a curated events website in Singapore. Your audience is 20-40 year olds who are culturally curious.

Rules:
- Exactly ONE sentence, maximum 200 characters
- Structure: start with WHAT the event IS (e.g. "A jazz trio concert...", "An open-air 10K run...", "A photography exhibition..."), then add the specific draw (who, what's special, why it's worth going)
- The reader should immediately understand the format (performance, exhibition, race, festival, screening, tasting, talk, etc.) from the first few words
- Don't start with "Join us", "Don't miss", "Come and", or the event's proper name — lead with the event type
- Tone: informative and slightly warm, not breathless or salesy

Available tags (assign 1-3 that fit best):
live & loud, culture fix, go see, game on, screen time, taste test, touch grass, free lah, last call, bring someone, once only, try lah

Respond with JSON only:
{"blurb": "your one sentence", "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]}
```

## 7. Frontend Design Spec

### Visual Direction

- **Dark mode** — background #0A0A0F (very dark navy-black), text #E8E8ED (warm off-white)
- **One accent color** — electric amber/gold #F5A623 for tags, interactive elements, arrows
- **Secondary accent** — soft blue #6B8AFF for links and hover states
- **Typography-driven design** — the type IS the design, minimal other decoration
- **Fonts:**
  - Display/headings: Space Grotesk (Google Fonts, free) — geometric, modern, slightly techy
  - Body: Inter (Google Fonts, free) — clean, highly readable
- **No images** — pure typography + color + spacing
- **Micro-interactions:** smooth fade/slide when navigating weeks, subtle hover lift on cards, tag pills have slight glow on hover
- **Mobile-first** — most users will visit on phone

## 8. Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) | SSR for SEO, simple routing, deploys free on Vercel |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Fast, utility-first, dark mode built-in |
| Database | SQLite via better-sqlite3 | Zero config, good enough for this scale, file-based |
| Scrapers | Python (requests + BeautifulSoup) | Simple, well-documented, good for HTML parsing |
| JS-heavy scraping | Playwright (Python) | For sites that need JS rendering (Esplanade if needed) |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude Haiku API | Cheapest, fast, good enough for filter + blurb |
| Email | Resend | Free tier (3k/mo), simple API, good deliverability |
| Hosting (frontend) | Vercel | Free tier, auto-deploys from git |
| Hosting (scrapers + cron) | Railway or DigitalOcean ($5/mo droplet) | Runs Python cron jobs |

```

Note: Scrapers are written in TypeScript (not Python) to keep a single language in the monorepo. Use `cheerio` instead of BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. This simplifies deployment — everything runs on Vercel (including API routes as serverless functions) and no separate Python server is needed.

## 10. Build Plan — Weekend-by-Weekend

### Weekend 1: Foundation + One Scraper + Frontend Shell

**Goal:** A working website that shows events from one source with LLM filtering.

Session 1 (Sat morning): Project setup
- Initialize Next.js project with Tailwind + TypeScript
- Set up SQLite database with schema
- Create CLAUDE.md
- Get basic dark-mode layout rendering with placeholder data

Session 2 (Sat afternoon): First scraper + LLM pipeline
- Build TheKallang scraper (simplest source, static HTML)
- Wire up Claude Haiku API for filter + blurb
- Test end-to-end: scrape → filter → blurb → database

Session 3 (Sun morning): Frontend
- EventCard component with real data from DB
- Week navigation (← →) with rolling 7-day window
- Empty state
- Mobile responsive

Session 4 (Sun afternoon): Polish + Deploy
- Basic styling polish
- Deploy to Vercel
- Test on mobile

**Deliverable:** Live website showing Kallang events, filtered and curated. ~60% of final product.

### Weekend 2: More Scrapers + Admin + Email

Session 5: Add Eventbrite + Esplanade scrapers
Session 6: Add SportPlus scraper + deduplication logic
Session 7: Admin panel (URL paste → LLM → publish)
Session 8: Email subscribe + Thursday digest

**Deliverable:** Full V1 with 4 scrapers, admin panel, email digest.

### Weekend 3: Polish + Distribution

Session 9: Frontend polish — animations, micro-interactions, tag colors
Session 10: Scraper health checks + alerting
Session 11: SEO basics (meta tags, OG image, sitemap)
Session 12: Share on Reddit r/singapore, LinkedIn, WhatsApp groups

**Note:** "Heads Up" section should be implemented after the core 7-day flow is solid — late Weekend 3 or as a fast follow.

**Deliverable:** Polished product ready for real users.
